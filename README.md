# mini_project

This repository contains a collection of engineering mini projects developed as a part of self-learning.  
The projects focus on IoT simulation using ESP32 and basic UI/UX application design.

---

## Project Overview
The projects in this repository are designed around key domains such as:
- Agriculture
- Safety systems
- Inclusivity
- UI/UX design

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Collision Prevention System 
An IoT-based obstacle detection system simulated using ESP32 and an ultrasonic sensor.

**Features:**
- Uses HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance
- Classifies obstacles based on vehicle height (Bike, Van, Bus)
- LED indicators:
  - 🟢 Green – Safe distance
  - 🟡 Yellow – Warning distance (with short buzzer alert)
  - 🔴 Red – Danger (with long buzzer alert)
- Interactive buttons to select vehicle type
- Simulated using Wokwi

**Technologies Used:**
- ESP32
- Arduino (C/C++)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- LEDs, Buzzer, Push Buttons

### 2️⃣ Lexicode – UI Design Mockup
A UI/UX mockup designed for an educational application concept.

**Highlights:**
- Clean and minimal interface
- Focus on usability and layout by color coding, prioritisation, syllable division
- C/Python console based

---

### 3️⃣ UI Design App Mockups
UI mockups created to practice basic UI/UX principles via experimentation (Figma and Canva)

**Highlights:**
- Multiple screen designs
- Color and layout experimentation
- Beginner-friendly UI concepts

---
