## Project Overview
The projects in this repository are designed around key domains such as:
- Agriculture
- Safety systems
- Inclusivity
- UI/UX design

## 📂 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Collision Prevention System 
An IoT-based obstacle detection system simulated using ESP32 and an ultrasonic sensor.

**Features:**
- Uses HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure distance
- Classifies obstacles based on vehicle height (Bike, Van, Bus)
- LED indicators:
  - 🟢 Green – Safe distance
  - 🟡 Yellow – Warning distance (with short buzzer alert)
  - 🔴 Red – Danger (with long buzzer alert)
- Interactive buttons to select vehicle type
- Simulated using Wokwi

**Technologies Used:**
- ESP32
- Arduino (C/C++)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- LEDs, Buzzer, Push Buttons

### 2️⃣ Lexicode – A console-based prototype to make learning easier for people with dyslexia

**Highlights:**
- Color Coding for prioritization
-Syllable division
-Confusables(p,q;b,d)differentiation
- TTS support in normal and slower mode
- C/Python console based
